<h1>Task-2 (basic): “Git a life”</h1>

Git is one of the most important skills to have as a software engineer. Almost all companies in the industry, use some kind of Version Control System. Git is the heart of open-source. Understanding the core concepts of Git can be quite difficult to some people.

The aim of this task is to learn the basic concepts of Git.

<b>Before attempting the task we request you to again read <a href="https://github.com/acmbitmesra/DevHack-0.2#some-points-to-consider">this.</a></b>

<b>All the teams who will complete this task will get equal points.</b>

<h3>It consists of two sub-tasks:</h3>

1. Complete atleast 10 levels of this <a href = "https://learngitbranching.js.org/">interactive tutorial</a>. Send us a screenshot of your progress in the google form given below. It's easy to cheat, but please focus more on learning. :D
Submit the form below when you have completed this sub-task.

2. Several people messaged us about "When the leaderboard will be released?". The thing is, we are too lazy to publish a leaderboard for you on GitHub repo. :P No need to fill a separate form for this.

Your task is to create a leaderboard <a href = "https://github.com/acmbitmesra/DevHack-0.2/blob/master/Leaderboard/After%20Task-1.md">here</a>. 

Each team member will send us a pull request to add them to the leaderboard in the following format:

<table>
  <tr>
  <th>S.No.</th><th>Rank</th><th>Team Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Member 1</th><th>Member 2</th><th>Member 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>ACM Dev Wing</td><td>100</td><td><a href = "https://github.com/sarthak-sopho">Sarthak Gupta</a></td><td><a href = "https://github.com/aayushsinha44">Aayush Sinha</a></td><td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="7"> Team who have not completed task-1 because of some reason are mentioned below</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>0</td><td>ACM CP Wing</td><td>0</td><td><a href = "">Aayush ka dost</a></td><td><a href = "">Sarthak ka dost</a></td><td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


The title of pull request should be "S.No-Rank-TeamName". For example "1-1-ACM Dev Wing".

In the above example, the team has two members. So, each member will send a separate pull request adding the relevant info. If the pull request is wrong, we'll close the pull request.
