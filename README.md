<h3><b>Some points to consider:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a competitive event, but it’s main motive will always be learning. Try to make most out of the tasks given in this event. The tasks are given with careful consideration and they will come handy in future for sure.</li><br />


<li>Although, we have given you the resources to complete the tasks, we also expect you to search for the doubts you encounter on the internet, watch youtube videos for learning stuff, and also read good blogs/articles. Also, try to discuss your problems with your teammates and friends.</li><br />

<li>If you think that the resources given are not enough, read the previous point again. We just don't want to spoonfeed you. :) </li><br />


<li>The points will be given to the teams in a relative manner of submissions.</li><br />


<li>A good developer is a person who knows “How to search on internet”, “What to search on internet”, and “What to extract from the search results”. Searching is also a skill.

<li>Experiment with the stuff you have done. (May be first give the right stuff for evaluation :P)</li>
