# DevHack-0.2

Software Development is a significant part of today’s world. There are certain things that every Software Engineer should know.

“DevHack” is an initiative by ACM Students' Chapter BIT Mesra which consists of a list of interesting development tasks.

The first edition "DevHack-0.1" was organized in 2017 by 2K13 batch. This is the second edition of this event. 

This online event begins from very basic tasks that can be done by anyone irrespective of their experience in dev. We will be also sharing relevant resources for doing these tasks.

<h3><b>Some points to consider:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a competitive event, but it’s main motive will always be learning. Try to make most out of the tasks given in this event. The tasks are given with careful consideration and they will come handy in future for sure.</li><br />


<li>Although we have given you the resources to complete the tasks, we also expect you to search for the doubts you encounter on the internet, watch youtube videos for learning stuff, and also read good blogs/articles. Also, try to discuss your problems with your teammates and friends.</li><br />

<li>If you think that the resources given are not enough, read the previous point again. We just don't want to spoonfeed you. :) </li><br />


<li>The points will be given to the teams in a relative manner of submissions.</li><br />


<li>A good developer is a person who knows “How to search on the internet”, “What to search on internet”, and “What to extract from the search results”. Searching is also a skill.

<li>Experiment with the stuff you have done. (Maybe first give the right stuff for evaluation :P)</li>

<li>You are also welcome to show your creativity on the tasks given.</li><br />


<li><b>If you are stuck on a problem for too long, don’t feel shy to ask us doubts. We’ll try to help you. :)</b></li><br />


<li>Please don’t get demotivated. Persistence is the key. For motivation, watch Jay Shetty or Sandeep Maheshwari’s videos on youtube. (>_<)</li><br />
